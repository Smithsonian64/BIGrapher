# BIGrapher
Like my grapher except includes polar functions and uses buffered images instead of objects to improve performace.

change button changes the plot to the next function in both cartesian and polar mode.
system button changes the coordinate system
animate button in cartesian mode does a single sinusoidal period of changing the x and y factors over time. In polar mode it is over 
the theta factor.
